# Groups

[ ] infection. 
    * Just re-render the current infection animation to use your color scheme.
    * Plots:
        * `infection-animation`
[ ] sources, points & cells. 
    * Show sources 
    * Show points 
    * Show field of selected sources
    * Show field at selected points
    * Show field at selected points from selected sources
    * Show overall field
    * Show selected cells
    * Show layers
    * Move sources to cell center
    * Move points to cell center 
    * Show field at selected cell
    * Highlight selected cells

    * This is going to be annoying. There's overlap in each part with the above, but each plot is its own thing.
